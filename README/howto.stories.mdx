> If you’re curious about what’s new in the Kit, and what’s changed, this is the right place.

## How To setup and Config Enviroment

1. Make sure nodejs and npm are installed on your machine by running `node -v;yarn -v;`
1. start by installing dependencies (all depend sol on nodejs>v12) `yarn install`
1. Create local .env file using `cp .env .env.local`, then modify `.env.local` with your local values if needed

> > please do not change anything in .env file; this is used as default values for deployment

## Run App for developement

### using Docker

`docker up --build`

### without Docker

To start frontend use:

- `yarn start`

It helps running tests to using

- `yarn test`

or if you prefer/using TDD you can run both in one command using

- `yarn tdd`

if you are following component driven development style, start storybook using:

- `yarn docs`

you can run all 3 (App, unit Testing, Frontend) using

- `yarn dev`

## Quality Tests

### Control

#### I. Unit Test

- `yarn test`

- `yarn test:ci`

#### II. e2e Test

- `yarn e2e`
- `yarn e2e:ci`

#### III. integration Test

- `yarn test:api`

#### V. GIT Hooks for testing

everytime you try to commit to repo; prettier will run to fix formating problems in code;

following are hooks installed using `husky` into your `.git/hooks`

- pre-commit: format all your (changed) code; then test your commit message is following standards
- pre-push: make sure app:
  - can be built;
  - run all unit tests

> code that ever reach repo should be deployable.

> fail early; fail fast; a failed gitlab pipeline mean a potential breaking of staging/production.. Please make sure everything pass locally before pushing
> gitlab pipelines are part of QA never depend on them to prevent a bug

## Quality Assurance

### Accessibility & Manual Testing

- `yarn docs`

### Code Style

- `yarn code:check`

- `yarn code:format`
